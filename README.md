# freeCodeCamp MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges

## MongoDB and Mongoose Section

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "MongoDB and Mongoose" section.

### Progress Summary (16 May 2025)

I'm just starting the "MongoDB and Mongoose" section of the course. So far, I've:

* Set up MongoDB Atlas account ✓
* Created a MongoDB cluster ✓
* Connected to MongoDB using Node.js ✓
* Created a test.js file to verify connectivity ✓

In these initial steps, I've learned how to:
- Create and configure a MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- Get a connection string for the database
- Connect to MongoDB using the Node.js MongoDB driver
- Perform basic operations (insert and find documents)

### Current Status ⏳

Working on the MongoDB and Mongoose challenges. I've successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas using the MongoDB driver, but haven't started implementing the Mongoose models and operations required by the freeCodeCamp curriculum yet.

### Custom Files

* **test.js**: A custom file I created to test the MongoDB connection. This file:
  - Connects to the MongoDB Atlas database
  - Creates a test collection and inserts a document
  - Retrieves and displays documents from the collection

### Next Steps

Tomorrow I'll work on completing these MongoDB and Mongoose challenges:
* Install and Set Up Mongoose
* Create a Model
* Create and Save a Record of a Model
* Create Many Records with model.create()
* Use model.find() to Search Your Database
* Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document
* Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By _id
* Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save
* Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()
* Delete One Document Using model.findByIdAndRemove
* Delete Many Documents with model.remove()
* Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results

## Certification Progress

1. Managing Packages with NPM (✓ COMPLETED)
2. Basic Node and Express (✓ COMPLETED)
3. MongoDB and Mongoose (⏳ IN PROCESS)
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects (UPCOMING)

## Skills Acquiring

* MongoDB Atlas setup and configuration
* MongoDB connection and basic operations
* Mongoose schema design and model creation
* Document creation, querying, updating, and deletion
* Advanced MongoDB querying techniques

*This repository demonstrates my systematic approach to learning database technologies as I build toward my ultimate goal of becoming an AI engineer. Understanding database systems is crucial for developing and deploying robust AI applications.*
