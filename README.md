# freeCodeCamp MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges

## MongoDB and Mongoose Section

This repository tracks my progress through freeCodeCamp's "Back End Development and APIs" certification, specifically the "MongoDB and Mongoose" section.

### Progress Summary (19 May 2025)

I've successfully completed the "MongoDB and Mongoose" section of the course! Here's what I accomplished:

* Set up MongoDB Atlas account ✓
* Created a MongoDB cluster ✓
* Connected to MongoDB using Node.js ✓
* Created a test.js file to verify connectivity ✓
* Implemented Mongoose Schema and Model ✓
* Completed all CRUD operations with Mongoose ✓
* Implemented query chaining ✓

In this section, I've learned how to:
- Create and configure a MongoDB Atlas cloud database
- Get a connection string for the database
- Connect to MongoDB using the Node.js MongoDB driver
- Create Mongoose Schemas and Models
- Perform all basic database operations:
  - Create documents (insertOne and insertMany)
  - Read documents (find, findOne, findById)
  - Update documents (findOneAndUpdate, findByIdAndUpdate)
  - Delete documents (findByIdAndRemove, remove)
- Chain query helpers for more complex queries

### Current Status ✅

All MongoDB and Mongoose challenges have been successfully completed! The implementation includes:
- Setting up Mongoose
- Creating a Person model with appropriate schema
- Creating and saving a record
- Creating multiple records
- Finding documents by various criteria
- Updating documents
- Deleting documents
- Chaining query helpers

### Custom Files

* **test.js**: A custom file I created to test the MongoDB connection. This file:
  - Connects to the MongoDB Atlas database
  - Creates a test collection and inserts a document
  - Retrieves and displays documents from the collection

* **myApp.js**: Contains all the Mongoose model definitions and CRUD operations required by the curriculum.

### Next Steps

Now that I've completed the MongoDB and Mongoose section, I'll be moving on to:
* Backend APIs and Microservices Projects

## Certification Progress

1. Managing Packages with NPM (✓ COMPLETED)
2. Basic Node and Express (✓ COMPLETED)
3. MongoDB and Mongoose (✓ COMPLETED)
4. Backend APIs and Microservices Projects (⏳ UPCOMING)

## Skills Acquired

* MongoDB Atlas setup and configuration
* MongoDB connection and basic operations
* Mongoose schema design and model creation
* Document creation, querying, updating, and deletion
* Advanced MongoDB querying techniques
* Query chaining for complex data retrieval operations

*This repository demonstrates my systematic approach to learning database technologies as I build toward my ultimate goal of becoming an AI engineer. Understanding database systems is crucial for developing and deploying robust AI applications.*
